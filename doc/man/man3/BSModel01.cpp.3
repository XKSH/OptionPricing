.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
We start by showing how to generate samples of random variables with standard normal distribution\&. In C++ we have at our disposal a function rand(), which generates integer numbers, simulating a sequence of i\&.i\&.d\&. random variables, uniformly distributed within the range from 0 to RAND_MAX\&. We can use the Box–Muller method to produce the following recipe for generating sample paths\&.
